                                    <p>This cookie policy (“Cookie Policy”) explains what cookies are and how Youturn genetic testing, Inc. (“Youturn genetic testing, we, us”) uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit websites owned and operated by Youturn genetic testing, including Youturn genetic testing, any other websites, pages, features, or content we own or operate, the Youturn genetic testing mobile app, and/or when you interact with Youturn genetic testing online advertisements or marketing emails (collectively the “Services”). We encourage you to read the full Cookie Policy so that you can understand what information is collected using cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how Youturn genetic testing uses that information. We will generally refer to cookies, web beacons, flash cookies, and pixels collectively as “cookies” or “tracking technology” in this policy. This Cookie Policy should be read together with our Privacy Statement and our Terms of Service.</p>
                                    <p>By using our Services, including Youturn genetic testing, you are agreeing that we can use cookies and other tracking technologies described in this Cookie Policy.</p>
                  

                 <div class="title-header"><h5>1. What are cookies?</h5></div>
                 <p>Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information, which are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer, mobile device or smartphone) when you visit or use our website or Services. Cookies can be recognized by the website that downloaded them — or other websites that use the same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has visited them before.</p>
                 <p>There are session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie lasts while your browser is open and is automatically deleted when you close your browser. A persistent cookie lasts until you or your browser deletes the cookies or they expire.</p>
                 <p>Cookies set by us are called “first party cookies”, while cookies set by parties other than Youturn genetic testing are called “third party cookies”. The parties that set third party cookies can recognize your device, both when you use the Services and when you use other websites or mobile apps. You should check the third party’s website for more information about how they use cookies and other tracking technologies. Both first party and third party cookies can serve a number of different functions, such as analytics, marketing and advertising.</p>
                 <p>Cookies collect and process both Personal Information (as defined in the Privacy Statement), as well as information that does not identify you as an individual. To the extent that IP addresses or similar identifiers are considered Personal Information by local law, we will treat these identifiers as prescribed under such applicable laws. If we combine non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

                    <li><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Web beacons, or “clear gifs”, are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.

<li>Youturn genetic testing may collect information about whether you open or click any links in the Services, Research or marketing communications that we send to you through web beacons.

<li><strong>Pixels:</strong> A “pixel” or “tag” can be placed on a website or within an email for the purposes of tracking your interactions with our websites or when emails are opened or accessed; pixels are often used in combination with cookies.</li>
                </ul>
   

                 <div class="title-header"><h5>3. How does Youturn genetic testing use cookies and other tracking technology?</h5></div>
                <p>Cookies and other forms of tracking technology play the role of enhancing and enabling usability and website processes across our Services and communications.

<p>We also use advertising tracking technology to assist with marketing our products and services to interested individuals. We may present you with an advertisement when you leave our Services because we think you might be interested in particular products and services. Cookies also help ensure marketing you see is more relevant to you and your interests.</p>


                 <div class="title-header"><h5>4. How long will cookies stay on my browsing device?</h5></div>
                <p>The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing. Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or are deleted (i.e. after you have finished browsing).
