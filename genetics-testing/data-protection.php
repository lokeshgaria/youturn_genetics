                                            <p>Youturn genetic testing is committed to the robust data privacy and security protections enabled by GDPR compliance.</p>

                                    <p>In 2016 the European Commission approved and adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a new framework for European data protection law. The GDPR is effective as of May 25, 2018 and applies to companies who process Personal Information of individuals in the EU. The GDPR strengthens the rights these individuals have regarding Personal Information relating to them, and seeks to unify data protection laws across Europe, regardless of where data is processed.</p>
