Except as specified herein, these TOS apply to any use of the Services, including but not limited to a) submitting a saliva sample for DNA extraction and processing, b) uploading a digital version of your Genetic Information and interacting with it on the Youturn genetic testing website, and/or c) creating and using a free Youturn genetic testing account without providing your saliva sample or Genetic Information. In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the TOS. You may not use the Services if you do not accept the TOS. You can accept the TOS by (1) clicking to accept or agree to the TOS, where this option is made available to you by Youturn genetic testing for any Service; or by (2) actually using the Services. In this case, you acknowledge and agree that Youturn genetic testing will treat your use of the Services as acceptance of the TOS from that point onwards. In addition, when using particular Services, you shall be subject to any guidelines or rules applicable to such Services that may be posted from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. Youturn genetic testing also may offer other services from time to time that are governed by different terms of service.</li>

                 </ul>


                <div class="title-header"><h5>3. Prerequisites</h5></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Whether you submit your own saliva sample, a saliva sample for anyone for whom you have legal authority to agree, or otherwise provide your own Genetic Information, you may not use the Services and may not accept the TOS if (1) you are not of legal age to form a binding contract with Youturn genetic testing, or (2) you are a person barred from receiving the Services under the laws of the jurisdiction in which you are resident or from which you use the Services.</li>
 <li>In addition to the conditions above, if you contribute or otherwise provide your own Genetic Information, you must be eighteen (18) years of age or older to agree to these TOS on behalf of yourself or those for whom you have legal authority to agree.</li>
 <li>If your use of the Services includes creating a Youturn genetic testing account, without submitting a saliva sample or otherwise providing Genetic Information, you must be thirteen (13) years of age or older to use the Services and accept the TOS.</li>
                </ul>

                 <div class="title-header"><h5>4. Description of the Services</h5></div>
                <p>The Services include access to the Youturn genetic testing public website and personal genotyping services, including the collection and analysis of your saliva sample. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, each new feature that augments or enhances the current Service shall be subject to the TOS. You acknowledge and agree that the Services are provided "AS-IS" and are based on the current state of the art of genetic research and technology in use by Youturn genetic testing at the time of the purchase, viewing or other use. As research progresses and scientific knowledge and technology evolve, Youturn genetic testing is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Youturn genetic testing provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Youturn genetic testing may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing some Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Youturn genetic testing's sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to specifically inform Youturn genetic testing when you stop using the Services. Youturn genetic testing assumes no responsibility for the use of Services outside the terms of this TOS or other applicable terms.<br><br>

In order to use the Services, you must obtain Internet access, either directly or through devices that access web-based content, and pay any service fees associated with such access. You are solely responsible for paying such fees. In addition, you must provide all equipment necessary to make such Internet connection, including a computer and modem or other access device. You are solely responsible for providing such equipment. You acknowledge and agree that while Youturn genetic testing may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Service, such fixed upper limits may be set by Youturn genetic testing at any time, at Youturn genetic testing discretion.</p>




  <div class="title-header"><h5>5. Risks and Considerations Regarding Youturn genetic testing Services</h5></div>
  <p>Once you obtain your Genetic Information, the knowledge is irrevocable. You should not assume that any information we may be able to provide to you, whether now or as genetic research advances, will be welcome or positive. You should also understand that as research advances, in order for you to assess the meaning of your DNA in the context of such advances, you may need to obtain further services from Youturn genetic testing, your physician, a genetic counselor, or other health care provider.</p>
  <p>We encourage you to talk to a genetic counselor, a health professional with special training in genetic conditions, prior to collecting your sample for testing to learn more so you can make an informed decision about whether testing is right for you. A genetic counselor also can help you understand your results and options.</p>

  <p><strong>Some people feel a little anxious about getting genetic health results.</strong> This is normal. If you feel very anxious, you should speak to your physician or a genetic counselor prior to collecting your sample for testing.</p>

  <p><strong>You may learn information about yourself that you do not anticipate. </strong> This information may evoke strong emotions and has the potential to alter your life and worldview. You may discover things about yourself that trouble you and that you may not have the ability to control or change (e.g., your father is not genetically your father, surprising facts related to your ancestry, or that someone with your genotype may have a higher than average chance of developing a specific condition or disease). These outcomes could have social, legal, or economic implications.</p>

    <p><strong>The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory process may result in errors. </strong> The laboratory may not be able to process your sample up to 5% of the time if your saliva does not contain a sufficient volume of DNA, you do not provide enough saliva, or the results from processing do not meet our standards for accuracy.* If the initial processing fails for any of these reasons, Youturn genetic testing will reprocess the same sample at no charge to the user. If the second attempt to process the same sample fails, Youturn genetic testing will offer to send another sample collection kit to the user to collect a second sample at no charge. If the user sends another sample and Youturn genetic testing's attempts to process the second sample are unsuccessful, (up to 0.65% of all samples fail the second attempt at testing according to Youturn genetic testing data obtained in 2019 for all genotype testing),* Youturn genetic testing will not send additional sample collection kits and the user will be entitled solely and exclusively to a complete refund of the amount paid to Youturn genetic testing, less shipping and handling, provided the user shall not resubmit another sample through a future purchase of the Service. If the user breaches this policy agreement and resubmits another sample through a future purchase of the Service and processing is not successful, Youturn genetic testing will not offer to reprocess the sample or provide the user a refund. Even for processing that meets our high standards, a small, unknown fraction of the data generated during the laboratory process may be un-interpretable or incorrect (referred to as "Errors"). As this possibility is known in advance, users are not entitled to refunds where these Errors occur.</p>

    <p><strong>You should not change your health behaviors solely on the basis Genetic Information from Youturn genetic testing.</strong> Make sure to discuss your Genetic Information with a physician or other health care provider before you act upon the Genetic Information resulting from Youturn genetic testing Services. For most common diseases, the genes we know about are only responsible for a small fraction of the risk. There may be unknown genes, environmental factors, or lifestyle choices that are far more important predictors. If your data indicate that you are not at elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, you should not feel that you are protected. The opposite is also true; if your data indicate you are at an elevated genetic risk for a particular disease or condition, it does not mean you will definitively develop the disease or condition. In either case, if you have concerns or questions about what you learn through Youturn genetic testing, you should contact your physician or other health care provider. Please note that genetic risk assessment is not applicable to results of carrier screening tests.</p>

    <p><strong>Genetic research is not comprehensive.</strong> While we measure many hundreds of thousands of data points from your DNA, only a small percentage of them are known to be related to human traits or health conditions. The research community is rapidly learning more about genetics, and an important mission of Youturn genetic testing is to conduct and contribute to this research. In addition, many ethnic groups are not included in genetic studies. Because interpretations provided in our Service rely on these published studies, some interpretations may not apply to you. Future scientific research may change the interpretation of your DNA. In the future, the scientific community may show previous research to be incomplete or inaccurate.</p>

    <p><strong>Genetic Information you share with others could be used against your interests.</strong> You should be careful about sharing your Genetic Information with others. Currently, very few businesses or insurance companies request genetic information, but this could change in the future. While the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (“GINA”) was signed into law in the United States in 2008, its protection against discrimination by employers and health insurance companies for employment and coverage issues, respectively, has not been clearly established. In addition, GINA does not cover life, long-term care, or disability insurance providers. Some, but not all, states and other jurisdictions have laws that further protect individuals with regard to their Genetic Information. You should consult a lawyer to understand the extent of legal protection of your Genetic Information before you share it with anybody.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, Genetic Information that you choose to share with your physician or other health care provider may become part of your medical record and through that route be accessible to other health care providers and/or insurance companies in the future. Genetic Information that you share with family, friends or employers may be used against your interests. Even if you share Genetic Information that has no or limited meaning today, that information could have greater meaning in the future as new discoveries are made. If you are asked by an insurance company whether you have learned Genetic Information about health conditions and you do not disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud.</p>

    <p><strong>Youturn genetic testing Services are for research, informational, and educational use only. We do not provide medical advice.</strong> The Genetic Information provided by Youturn genetic testing is for research, informational, and educational use only. This means two things. First, many of the genetic discoveries that we report have not been clinically validated, and the technology we use, which is the same technology used by the research community, to date has not been widely used for clinical testing. Second, in order to expand and accelerate the understanding and practical application of genetic knowledge in health care, we invite all genotyped users to participate in Youturn genetic testing Research. Participation in such research is voluntary and based upon an IRB-approved consent document. As a result of the current state of genetic knowledge and understanding, our Services are for research, informational, and educational purposes only. The Services are not intended to be used by the customer for any diagnostic purpose and are not a substitute for professional medical advice. You should always seek the advice of your physician or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health.</p>

    <p>Youturn genetic testing does not endorse, warranty or guarantee the effectiveness of any specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on our website. If we provide to you on our website any recommendations that identify for you, based on your Genetic Information and Self-Reported Information and scientific literature or research, potentially actionable information, this information is intended for informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other healthcare provider. As explained on our website, Youturn genetic testing believes that (a) genetics is only part of the picture of any individual's state of being, (b) the state of the understanding of Genetic Information is rapidly evolving and at any given time we only comprehend part of the picture of the role of genetics, and (c) only a physician or other health care provider can assess your current state of health or disease, taking into account many factors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current symptoms, if any. Reliance on any information provided by Youturn genetic testing, Youturn genetic testing employees, others appearing on our website at the invitation of Youturn genetic testing, or other visitors to our website is solely at your own risk.</p>

    <p>While we are licensed in the State of California as a clinical laboratory, not all jurisdictions require our Services to be subject to license. Therefore, we are not universally licensed by all state, federal, or international authorities for genetic testing conducted for health and disease-related purposes. In addition, there are certain jurisdictions in which we do not offer our Services because we do not have the required licenses.</p>

<div class="title-header"><h5>28. Dispute Resolution (including Arbitration, Class Action Waiver and Time to Initiate Action)</h5></div>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>

<ul>
<li>Initial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at customercare@23andme.com to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Service. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. You agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.
</li>
<li>Agreement to Binding Arbitration. If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to Section 28(a) above, then either you or we may initiate binding arbitration. Except for any disputes excluded below in Section 28(d), all claims arising out of or relating to these TOS (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. The parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these TOS, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these TOS is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of these TOS shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures. If you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars ($250) and the claim is found to be non-frivolous, we will pay the additional cost. If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS. We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration, other than costs incurred by you for legal counsel, travel and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses not constituting fees or amounts payable to JAMS. You will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration. We will also pay JAMS to reimburse you for any portion of the $250 filing fee that is more than what you would otherwise have to pay to file suit in a court of law.<br><br>You understand that, absent this mandatory provision, you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. You further understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</li>

<li>Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. You and we each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in our respective individual capacities only and not as a class action, and you and we each expressly waive our respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Section 28(b) shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</li>

<li>Exceptions. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief (i) in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction, and (ii) any disputes relating to intellectual property rights, obligations, or any infringement claims.</li>

<li>30 Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Sections 28(b) and 28(c) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at arbitrationoptout@23andme.com. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Service, or the effective date of the first set of TOS containing an Arbitration and Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver section otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</li>

<li>Term for Cause of Action. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or the TOS must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</li>
<li>Exclusive Venue for Litigation. To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 28(b) do not apply or if you have opted out of arbitration, you agree that any litigation shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in Santa Clara County, California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). You and we expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Santa Clara County, California for any litigation other than small claims court actions. In the event of litigation relating to these TOS or the Service, you agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to a jury trial, except where a jury trial waiver is not permissible under applicable law.</li>
